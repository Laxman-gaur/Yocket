# Yocket
Hi Team,  <br />

I have added all the APIs which were mentioned in the assignment.  <br />
I have used Microsoft SQL Server. You Can find credentials of DB in .env File. (I have made this SQL Server public for now).  <br />

Also, you can find postman collection - FeedPortal.postman_collection.json  <br />

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ <br />
I have also added DB Schema File - FeedPortal.sql (But best would be to login into the DB by SSMS - You can find DB Creds in .env file) <br />
Note: - When Using SSMS <br />
Server Name: - feedportal.database.windows.net,1433 <br />
Authentication: - SQL Server Authentication <br />

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ <br />
