# Yocket
Hi Team,  <br />

I have added all the APIs which were mentioned in the assignment.  <br />
I have used Microsoft SQL Server. You Can find credentials of DB in .env File. (I have made this SQL Server public for now).  <br />

Also, you can find postman collection - FeedPortal.postman_collection.json  <br />
